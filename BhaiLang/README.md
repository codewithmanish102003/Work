# BhaiLang Project

A fun programming project using BhaiLang - a programming language with a unique syntax!

## What is BhaiLang?

BhaiLang is a programming language that uses Hindi-inspired keywords and syntax. It's designed to be fun and educational while maintaining the power of traditional programming languages.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run your BhaiLang program:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   Or directly:
   ```bash
   npx bhailang index.bhai
   ```

## BhaiLang Syntax Examples

### Basic Structure
- `hi bhai` - Start of program
- `bye bhai` - End of program
- `bol bhai` - Print/output statement
- `bhai ye hai` - Variable declaration

### Control Structures
- `jab tak bhai` - While loop
- `agar bhai` - If statement
- `nahi to bhai` - Else if statement

### Your Current Program
Your `index.bhai` file demonstrates:
- Variable declaration and assignment
- While loops
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Basic arithmetic operations

## Running the Program

```bash
npm start
```

This will execute your BhaiLang program and output:
- Numbers from 0 to 4
- "b is equal to zero" when b equals 0
- "b is equal to a" when b equals 3
